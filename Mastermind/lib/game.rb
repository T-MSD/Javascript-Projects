    There are 8 colors you can choose from:

    ðŸŸ¢ - Green
    ðŸ”´ - Red
    ðŸŸ¡ - Yellow
    ðŸ”µ - Blue
    ðŸŸ£ - Purple
    âš« - Black
    âšª - White
    ðŸŸ  - Orange

    You have to select 4 random colors until guess the correct code.
    You will be prompted 4 times, one for each color and your guess will follow that order. Like this:

    Round number 1
    Please enter color number 1:
    Please enter color number 2:
    ...

    All you have to do is type the color like 'green' or 'white'.

    #{'You have 12 attempts to guess the code'.colorize(:cyan)}

    The game will give you feedback like this:

    âšª is in the right place!
    ðŸŸ¢ is in the wrong place...

    You can quit at any time by pressing ctrl+c, then type 'yes' to quit and 'no' to continue the game.

    #{'Good Luck!'.colorize(:green)}
