# Ruby + JS Projects
I'm currently enrolled in [**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com/) course, where I'm learning and honing my web development skills. This repository serves as a collection of the various projects I'll be building throughout the course. Each project is designed to demonstrate my progress, applying the concepts and techniques I've learned in real-world scenarios. As I advance through the curriculum, this repository will continue to grow, showcasing a wide range of skills from basic programming to more complex, full-stack development.
